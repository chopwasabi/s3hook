# S3.js

A Serverless Client for AWS Simple Storage Service

## *Disclaimer*

As this library self signs its own requests, it requires the access key
**and the secret key**. For this reason, it should only be used for internal
applications where the keys are only provided to trusted users. In addition,
the key set should **only** have access to a particular
bucket and to a particular prefix.

## Example

``` js
S3.set({
  accessKeyId: '...',
  secretAccessKey: '...'
});

var endpoint = 'https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com';
var bucket = 'jpillora-aus';
var key = 'restricted/secret.txt';
var url = [endpoint,bucket,key].join('/');

S3.getObject(url, function(data) {
  console.log(data.responseText)
});
```
