# S3 Hook

Transparent (via [XHook](https://github.com/jpillora/xhook)), Cross-domain (via [XDomain](https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain)), Client-side S3 Request Signing

All requests sent to `s3.amazonaws.com` are modified to include the correct `Authorization` header for the given credentials. `s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com` is also supported. To use other S3 endpoints or custom domains, see API for usage of the [proxy](#s3hookproxyurl) function.

### *Disclaimer*

As this library self signs its own requests, it requires the access key
**and the secret key**. For this reason, it should only be used for internal
applications where the keys are only provided to trusted users, or in cases
where a key is provided by the client and never sent to the server. In addition,
the key set should **only** have access to a particular
bucket and to a particular prefix.

## Example

``` js
//enable hook
s3hook.set("AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE","k3nL7gH3+PadhTEVn5EXAMPLE");

//choose your favourite XHR library, jQuery for example...
//then just use the AWS REST API...

//get bucket object list
$.get('https://s3.amazonaws.com/jpillora-usa/')

//put an object
$.ajax({type:'PUT', url:'https://s3.amazonaws.com/jpillora-usa/foo.txt', data:'hello world!' });
```

*Tip: Set the `x-amz-acl: public-read` header to make an object public*
