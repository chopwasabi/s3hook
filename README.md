# S3 Hook



## *Disclaimer*

As this library self signs its own requests, it requires the access key
**and the secret key**. For this reason, it should only be used for internal
applications where the keys are only provided to trusted users. In addition,
the key set should **only** have access to a particular
bucket and to a particular prefix.

## Example

``` js

```
